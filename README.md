## Prerequisites: HTML and JavaScript Basics

### HTML Basics

#### 1. Create a Simple Web Page
- **Problem:** Design a basic web page with a title, heading, paragraph, and a link to Google.

#### 2. Use Basic Form Elements
- **Problem:** Create a form with an input field (text type), a checkbox, and a submit button.

#### 3. Create a Table
- **Problem:** Design a table with three rows and two columns, representing names and ages.

#### 4. Embed Images
- **Problem:** Display an image on a web page and use alt text for the image.

#### 5. Hyperlinks
- **Problem:** Create three links: one to an external website, one to another local HTML file, and one that opens an email client.

### JavaScript Basics

#### 6. Display Alert on Page Load
- **Problem:** Write a script that shows an alert saying "Welcome to my website!" when the page is loaded.

#### 7. Console Logging
- **Problem:** Create a script that logs the message "This is a console message" to the browser's console.

#### 8. Using Variables
- **Problem:** Declare a variable named 'greeting' with the value "Hello, World!". Display this in an alert.
- 
<!-- 
#### 9. Basic Arithmetic Operations
- **Problem:** Declare two variables with numeric values. Calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Log results to the console. -->

#### 10. Basic DOM Manipulation
- **Problem:** Have a paragraph with some placeholder text in your HTML. Use JavaScript to change this text when a button is clicked.

### Setting up the Environment

#### 11. Linking External JS Files
- **Problem:** Create a separate JavaScript (.js) file and link it to your HTML. Write a function in this .js file to alert a greeting and call this function from an HTML button.

#### 12. Browser Compatibility
- **Problem:** Open your web page in at least three different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and ensure it looks consistent.

#### 13. Basic Error Handling
- **Problem:** Intentionally write a JavaScript error in your script (like a reference to an undeclared variable). Open the browser console to understand the error message and then fix it.

#### 14. Inline vs. External Scripts
- **Problem:** Write two scripts: one inline in the HTML and one in an external .js file. Log different messages from each to understand the order of execution.

#### 15. Basic Event Handling
- **Problem:** Create a button in your HTML. Write JavaScript so that when the button is clicked, the background color of the page changes.
